#Notes from: "Tutorial on meta-analysis in R"
# Fixed -> Same mean ES, zero between-study variance
# Fixed effect model: The observed effects are sampled from a distribution with true effect μ, and variance σ2. The observed effect
# T1 is equal to μ+εi (Borenstein et al 2007) 
#
# Random effects: Random effects model. The observed effect T1 (box) is sampled from a distribution with true effect θ1, and variance σ2
# This true effect θ1, in turn, is sampled from a distribution with mean μ and variance τ 2 (Borenstein et al 2007). 
#
# Random -> Different mean ES, between-study variance
# ES= effect size
#The Random effects model regards the studies as a sample of a larger universe of studies.
#The Random effects model can be used to infer what would likely happen if a new study were performed, the FE model cannot.
# Common practice is to report both fixed and random effects model results.
#
# "Under the random effects model we allow that the true effect could vary from study to study. 
# For example, the effect size might be a little higher if the subjects are older, or more educated, or healthier; or if the study used a
# slightly more intensive or longer variant of the intervention; or if the effect was measured more reliably; and so on. 
# The studies included in the meta-analysis are assumed to be a random sample of the relevant distribution of effects, and
# the combined effect estimates the mean effect in this distribution (Borenstein et al 2007) "
#
# In the REM: Boxes for the large studies have decreased area while those for the small studies such as have increased area. As we move from fixed effect to random effects,
# extreme studies will lose influence if they are large, and will gain influence if they are small. (Borenstein et al 2007)
#
# "As compared with the fixed effect model, the weights assigned under random effects are more balanced. Large studies are less likely
# to dominate the analysis and small studies are less likely to seem less important."
