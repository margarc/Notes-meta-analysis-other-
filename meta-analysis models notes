#Notes from: "Tutorial on meta-analysis in R"
# Fixed -> Same mean ES, zero between-study variance
# Random -> Different mean ES, between-study variance
# ES= effect size
#The Random effects model regards the studies as a sample of a larger universe of studies.
#The Random effects model can be used to infer what would likely happen if a new study were performed, the FE model cannot.
Common practice is to report both fixed and random effects model results.
