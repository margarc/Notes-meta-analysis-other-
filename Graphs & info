Funnel plot: Standard error likely best choice for vertical axes -in the absence of bias the, the expected shape is a symmetrical funnel.
Horizontal axes: Treatment effect/s measure e.g. OR 
Vertical axes: A measure of study precision e.g. standard error 
Shape: Funnel with straight 95% confidence lines. 

*Larger studies have the smallest standard errors so axis has to be inverted (st.err= 0 at top) so that larger trials = placed at 
top of the graph.

# Funnel plot asymmetry wrongly equated with publication or other reporting biases.
# Also known as 
# "Small study effects": the phenomenon that smaller studies sometimes show different, often larger, treatment effects than large ones. 

# 
# Funnel plot = scatter plot that shows the effect estimates from individual studies against some measure of each study's size or precision.
# Usually standard error of the effect estimate is chosen as the measure of study size and it is plotted on the vertical axis with a reversed 
# scale that places larger, more powerful studies at the top. Smaller studies would scatter at the bottom 
# from (Sterne 2011)
# Possible sources of asymmetry in funnel plots (adapted from Egger et al):
# 1. Reporting biases e.g. publication biases, selective outcome reporting, selective analysis reporting.
# 2. Poor methodological quality leading to spuriously inflated effects in smaller studies e.g poor methodological design, inadequate analysis. 
# 3. True heterogeneity
# 4. Sampling variation can lead to an association between the intervention effect and its standard error
# 5. Asymmetry by chance
