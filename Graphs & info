Funnel plot: Standard error likely best choice for vertical axes -in the absence of bias the, the expected shape is a symmetrical funnel.
Horizontal axes: Treatment effect/s measure e.g. OR 
Vertical axes: A measure of study precision e.g. standard error 
Shape: Funnel with straight 95% confidence lines. 

*Larger studies have the smallest standard errors so axis has to be inverted (st.err= 0 at top) so that larger trials = placed at 
top of the graph. 

All above from paper: Sterne & Egger 2001
