Funnel plot: Standard error likely to be best choice for the vertical axes -in the absence of bias the, the expected shape
is a symmetrical funnel.
Horizontal axes: Treatment effect/s 
Vertical axes: A measure of study precision
*Larger studies have the smallest standard errors so axis has to be inverted (st.err= 0 at top) so that larger trials = placed at 
top of the graph.
